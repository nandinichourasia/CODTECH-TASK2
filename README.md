OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:<br>
PROJECT: Weather forecasting website using HTML, CSS and JS

OBJECTIVE:

This is a simple weather forecast application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows users to enter a location and receive real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions. 

KEY ACTIVITIES:

- *Location-Based Weather:* Enter a city name to get the current weather conditions.
- *Temperature Display:* Shows the temperature in Celsius.
- *Weather Description:* Provides a brief description (e.g., clear sky, rain, etc.).
- *Humidity and Wind Speed:* Displays the humidity percentage and wind speed.
- *Dynamic Weather Images:* The background image changes based on the weather condition (e.g., clouds, clear sky, rain).

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

HTML is used to create and structure the web page including headings, paragraphs, and other content. It makes web pages accessible to users through text, visual formatting, and search factors.

To define the styling and layout of web pages and make them more visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible CSS is used in the project.

JavaScript is used since it adds interactivity to web pages, such as drop-down menus, form validation, real-time data display etc.
